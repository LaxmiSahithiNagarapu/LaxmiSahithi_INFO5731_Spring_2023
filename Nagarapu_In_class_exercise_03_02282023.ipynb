The frequency vector for the data cloud would provide me with information on the features that the users are examining, and the sentiment analysis would help me comprehend the input from users.I want to apply the POS tagging method to analyze the sentiment in review content. The text's parts of speech identify each sentence's primary context, purposes, and usage. Using the definitions and the context, I will classify each word in the text according to the part of speech it belongs to in this approach. Nouns, verbs, personal pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, coordinating conjunctions, and interjections are a few speech markers that I prefer to concentrate on. These reviews with POS tags are transformed into a matrix of integers and provided to classifiers as input. The Classifier will identify the text's emotion.\n",
